# Yocto Recipe: calculator-autotools-staticlib

## Description
The "calculator-autotools-staticlib" recipe demonstrates how to create a recipe for a calculator program that is built using the Autotools build system and linked statically with a library. This README provides instructions on how to integrate the "calculator-autotools-staticlib" recipe into a Yocto-based system.

## Prerequisites
- Yocto Project environment set up and initialized
- Access to the Yocto project source files
- Familiarity with Yocto build system concepts
- Understanding of the Autotools build system and static linking

## Usage
To include the "calculator-autotools-staticlib" recipe in your Yocto image, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Yocto Source Directory
Navigate to the directory containing your Yocto project source files.

### 2. Add Recipe
Add the "calculator-autotools-staticlib" recipe to your Yocto project's layer. You can create a new recipe file or add it to an existing one.

### 3. Specify SRC_URI
In the "calculator-autotools-staticlib" recipe file, specify the source URI (SRC_URI) for fetching the calculator program's source code and any additional library source code. For example:
SRC_URI = "file://calculator.c
file://libmycalculator.c
file://libmycalculator.h"


Replace `<source-files>` with the names of the source files containing the calculator program and library code.

### 4. Build Recipe
Build your Yocto image as usual using the `bitbake` command. For example:
bitbake <image-name>


Replace `<image-name>` with the name of your desired Yocto image.

### 5. Verify Build
After building the Yocto image successfully, verify that the "calculator-autotools-staticlib" recipe is built and included in the image.

## Notes
- Ensure that the calculator program's build system is properly configured to use Autotools for building and linking with the static library.
- Additional customization options for integrating Autotools-based recipes with static libraries into the Yocto build system can be explored in the Yocto Project documentation.
